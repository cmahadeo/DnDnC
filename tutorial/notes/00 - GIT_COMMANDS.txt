GIT INITIAL COMMANDS

Initialize git folder:
> git init

Add git remote address:
> git remote add <address> <github repository URL>
(e.g.git remote add cndnc https://github.com/cmahadeo/DnDnC.git)

Showing all remote addresses:
> git remote


GIT PUSHING COMMANDS: 

Working area > Staging area > Local repository > Global repository
i.e. Stage > Commit > Push

Stage a file:
> git add <file name>

Stage all changed files:
> git add .

Commit file:
> git commit -m 'Insert comment here'

Push file (branch is typically master):
> git push <remote> <branch>
(e.g. git push cndnc master)

Check status of added files:
> git status


GIT SYNCING COMMANDS:

Syncing occurs in two steps: Fetch, then merge

Pull (fetch + merge) repository:
> git pull <remote> <branch>

Advanced pull repository (do this if regular pull does not work):
> git pull --rebase <remote> <branch>

Fetch repository:
> git fetch <remote> <branch>

Merge repository:
> git merge


TIPS:
- Open git bash in folder you wish to sync with your github repository
- Shift + Insert is the Paste command in the git bash window
- The difference between git pull and git fetch is:
 - git pull tries to do all the work automatically for you. It is an auto combo of git fetch and git mergem, and is 'unsafe'
 - git fetch takes all changes not synced from your global repository to your local repository. It does not merge them with your current branch.
 - For our purposes, using git pull is fine 99% of the time.
