Python is an object-oriented language

- A class is a type of object
- An object is an instance of a class

There are two types of classes in Python:

MUTABLE CLASSES
 - string (str)
 - list (list)
 - dictionary (dict)
 - custom classes*

IMMUTABLE CLASSES
 - None
 - Boolean (bool)
 - integer (int)
 - float (float)
 - tuple (tuple)

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE

MUTABLE CLASS
 - Has methods.
 - A variable's mutable value can be changed without changing its memory address.
 - Treated as a global variable. If used as an argument in a function,  no local variable will be created.

IMMUTABLE CLASS
 - Does not have methods
 - A variable's immutable value cannot be changed without changing its memory address.
 - Treated as a 'local' variable. If used as an argument in a function, a local copy will be created.
