def is_digit(s):
    '''
    Given s is a string, returns True if every character in s is a digit. False otherwise.
    This is the same as s.isdigit()
    '''
    
    return None


def separate(s):
    '''
    Given a string of two words separated by a space, returns a tuple of the two individual words as strings.
    This is the same as s.split(' ')
    '''
    
    return None


def dict_copy(d):
    '''
    Given d is any dictionary, returns a copy of d (with a different memory address).
    This is the same as d.copy()
    '''
    
    return None


def count(L, x):
    '''
    Given L is a list, x is any value, returns the number of occurances of x in L.
    This is the same as L.count(x).
    '''
    
    return None


def pop_list(L, i):
    '''
    Given L is a list, removes the item at index i of L. Returns a copy of L with x removed, with all other
    elements in the same order. This is similar to L.pop(i).
    '''
    
    return None


def make_range(*args):
    '''
    Given each arg is an integer:
    - If args = (stop): Return a list of all integers from 0 to stop (exclusive)
    - If args = (start, stop): Returns a list of all integers from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive)
    - If args = (start, stop, step): Returns a list of all integers step apart from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive)
    
    All additional arguments past the first 3 are ignored. This is similar to range(*args).
    '''
    
    return None


def make_dict(key, **kwargs):
    '''
    Returns a dictionary of all kwargs, with the exception of key.
    '''
    
    return None
